In my first Data Structures class I was assigned a project where I was required
to gather input from a user and then operate on that input to evaluate a
mathematical expression. While I was writing the program I discovered how to
dynamically allocate memory for an array of characters input from `stdin`. While
I ended up abandoning the technique because it wasn't going to work in that
specific project, I wanted to document it here so I wouldn't forget about it
and so that others might benefit from my small insight.
